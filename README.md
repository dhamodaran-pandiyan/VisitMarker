# VisitMarker for Google Search Results

**VisitMarker** is a Chrome extension that enhances your Google search experience by displaying the last time you visited a domain directly on the search results page. This lightweight extension uses your browser's history to provide quick and useful insights, helping you navigate more efficiently.

---

## Features

- Displays "Last visited" information next to **main search result titles** on Google.
- Works dynamically with Google search results, including additional results loaded via scrolling or pagination.
- Avoids duplication of data or redundant processing for optimized performance.
- Respects user privacy by using local browser history only.

---

## How It Works

1. **Targeting Main Results**: The extension identifies main search result titles (usually in blue text) by targeting specific DOM elements (`<a>` tags containing `<h3>`).
2. **Fetching History**: It uses the Chrome `history` API to find the most recent visit to a domain.
3. **Displaying Data**: Appends the "Last visited" timestamp to the search result titles.
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Handles dynamically loaded content using a `MutationObserver`.
