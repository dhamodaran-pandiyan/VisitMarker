# VisitMarker for Google Search Results

**VisitMarker** is a Chrome extension that enhances your Google search experience by displaying the last time you visited a webpage directly on the search results page.

---

## Features

- Displays "Last visited" information next to **main search result titles** on Google.
- Works dynamically with Google search results, including additional results loaded via scrolling or pagination.
- Avoids duplication of data or redundant processing for optimized performance.
- Respects user privacy by using local browser history only.


## Privacy

This extension only uses your local browser history to display "last visited" information. No data is sent to external servers or stored outside your browser as it uses only local chrome.storage API to store data.


## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **`history`**: To fetch your browsing history and retrieve the last visit timestamps.
- **Host permission** for `https://*.google.com/*`: Ensures the extension works ONLY on Google search pages.



## How It Works

1. **Targeting Main Results**: The extension identifies main search result titles (usually in blue text) by targeting specific DOM elements.
2. **Fetching History**: It uses the Chrome `history` API to find the most recent visit to a domain.
3. **Displaying Data**: Appends the "Last visited" timestamp to the search result titles.
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Handles dynamically loaded content using a `MutationObserver`.
